🔹 Use: "Running SQL Queries to Retrieve Data"  

6.Make Headings Visually Stand Out  
Use bold text, larger font size, or color to differentiate headings.  
Keep formatting consistent throughout the document.  
Example:  
🔹 H1 (Main Title) → Large & Bold  
🔹 H2 (Section Title) → Slightly Smaller & Bold  
🔹 H3 (Subsection Title) → Italicized or Underlined  

7.Use Headings for Easy Navigation (Especially in Digital Docs)  
In long documents, headings help users scan & find what they need quickly.  
For online content, use table of contents, hyperlinks, or collapsible sections.  
Example:  
🔹 User Manual Table of Contents:  
    ✔ 1. Getting Started (Jump to Section)
